If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
From the average value, seems like the person preferred energetic, dance songs. Maybe he/she likes disco music


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
I feel like averaging a value of the TOP100 may not be representative enough.
Think we should weigh the songs by the listening minutes/times, and also find the mode of the music genre the listener preferred.
