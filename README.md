# CS50x

CS50x through edX Progress
This is my journey to finish the CS50

<h2> Week 0 Problem Set - Scratch </h2>
<h3> Sratch - <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1040835710/">Penalty ShootOut Game</a> </h3>
<h4> Instruction <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week0%20-%20Scratch"> Code </a> </h4>
The player will use arrow keys to control the direction of the ball, press: <br>
↑ to shoot the ball in the middle. <br>
→ to shoot the ball to the right.  <br>
← to shoot the ball to the left.   <br>
And press space to shoot the ball. <br>
The goalkeeper will guess your direction to save the ball. If either the player scored 5 goals, or the goalkeeper made five saves, the game will end.

<h2> Week 1 Problem Set - Introduction to C</h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week1%20-%20C/me"> Hello, Me</a> </h3>
<p> Pretty Easy </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week1%20-%20C/mario-more"> Mario (More)</a> </h3>
<p> Pretty Easy - get myself familiar with the loop and basics in C </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week1%20-%20C/credit"> Credit </a> </h3>
<p> Interesting Program to get to know how to identify the credit card issuer and implement the logic to validate the checksum of the credit card </p>

<h2> Week 2 Problem Set - Arrays </h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week2%20-%20C%20Array/scrabble"> Scrabble </a> </h3>
<p> Easy Task to store the points of alphabet in Scrabble in an array and use it to calculate the score of words for 2 players </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week2%20-%20C%20Array/readability"> Readability </a> </h3>
<p> Utilizing Coleman-Liau index, I wrote a program to detect the reading levels of the passage provided</p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week2%20-%20C%20Array/substitution"> Substitution </a> </h3>
<p> Using a 26-character pre-defined key to encrypt text, it replaces the alphabet of the plaintext with the character in the key </p>

<h2> Week 3 Problem Set - Algorithms</h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week3%20-%20Algorithm/Algorithm">Sorting Algorithms</a> </h3>
<p> I implement the sorting algorithms in C for practice </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week3%20-%20Algorithm/plurality"> Plurality </a> </h3>
<p> Complete a program for the first past the post voting system </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week3%20-%20Algorithm/tideman"> Tideman </a> </h3>
<p> This is one of the biggest challenges in this CS50 course since the beginning. In this program, I will first need to store the preferences of the candidates. Store the winner and loser in a pair array. Sort the pair array by the preference power, i.e. votes margin. I use merge Sort here. Then, the pair was locked to prevent creating cycles in the graph. And finally print the winner </p>
<p> Thanks to CS50 for breaking down the problem into small and manageable pieces, or else it would be very hard for a beginner to code it.</p>

<h2> Week 4 Problem Set - Memory</h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week4%20-%20Memory/volume"> Volume </a> </h3>
<p> Introduction of pointer this week, we are now handling WAV file to read the WAV file, copy its header and then output the audio with multiplication of the input factor.</p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week4%20-%20Memory/filter-more">Filter (More)</a> </h3>
<p> Another Challenge to handle the filter in the .bmp file. A .bmp file also has headers and content stored after the header. In this problem set, we will need to add a filter to the picture by manipulating the content of the image (content after header). To grayscale, blur, or make a reflection to an image is not hard at all. But detecting edges is harder and we will need to use the Sobel Operator. Amazingly, I can use C to create a filter on the image. </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week4%20-%20Memory/recover">Recover</a> </h3>
<p> A smaller function compared to the filter. Interestingly, I can now recover a jpeg file even if it is deleted. </p>

<h2> Week 5 Problem Set - Data Structure</h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week5%20-%20Data%20Structure/inheritance"> Inheritance </a> </h3>
<p> Further strengthen my knowledge on pointers, with the blood type Inheritance. Remind me of the biology class in the secondary school. Pretty easy one with the hint from the distributed code. Warm-up to the Speller I guess.</p>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week5%20-%20Data%20Structure/speller"> Speller </a> </h3>
<p> This is easier than I thought, when I can tackle the problem in smaller and manageable pieces. It is a really good exercise to implement a hash table searching algorithm, and also for me to understand how a hash table works and how important a hash function is. </p>

<h2> Week 6 Problem Set - Python</h2>
<h2> Week 7 Problem Set - SQL</h2>
<h2> Week 8 Problem Set - HTML</h2>
<p> As I am a computer programming student, SQL, Python version of the previous coded C program, and  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are like a breeze for me. </p>
